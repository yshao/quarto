Austria cares about keeping things peaceful and quiet. In Vienna there's a law that quiet hours must be kept between 10pm and 6am every day, and the residents take this extremely seriously. As almost anyone from Vienna and they'll invariably have at least a story or two of their having the police called for a noise disturbance complaint.
